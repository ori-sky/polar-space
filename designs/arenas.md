# Proposed Game Modes

## Deathmatch (dm)

Exactly what it says on the tin, free-for-all deathmatch in an arena.  
*Victory Condition*: Pilot with highest score after time limit reached, or first player to reach point limit  
(also comes in "team deathmatch (tdm) flavour")

## Capture the Freighter (ctf)

"Single Flag Capture the Flag" but with a large freighter or cargo-pod that has to be somehow taken to a team base to score.  
*Victory Condition*: Team with highest score after time limit reached, or first team to reach point limit.

## Freighter Escort (esc)

Attack/Defence where Team 1 has to retrieve a freighter from Team 2 and escort it back to their (Team 1s) capital ship.  
*Victory Condition*: Team 1 retrieves freighter before time expires **OR** Team 2 stops Team 1 from retrieving freighter within time limit.

## Capital Destruction (cd)

Teams must attempt to destroy the other teams capital ship by delivering *doomsday bombs* to them.  
*Victory Condition*: Last team with capital still standing wins, Team with least damage taken when time expires.

## Resource Wars (rw)

Teams must attempt to collect resources from the arena with specialised mining/collection ships and return them to their base. Team must tactically decide how to assign players (Fighter/Resource Harvester).  
*Victory Condition*: Team with most resources after time expires, First team to reach point limit.

# Map/Arena Concepts

## dm_blackhole

> A supermassive black hole sits at the centre of the arena
> It pulls on anything that gets too close, any ships that fly into it are destroyed
> Nearby are shipwrecks, slowly being pulled apart, their chunks slowly drifting into the arena centre. (Perhaps also a nearby shattered planet?)

## dm_stripmine

> A (or several) large asteroid(s) with orbital mining platform(s litter the arena)
> Mining lasers fire at random, and powerful tractor beams draw the rock chunks into the orbital platform.

## dm_shipyard

> A shipyard in space, massive webbed structure holding a huge, unfinished capital ship in place.

## dm_asteroids

> An expansive and sprawling asteroid field with old mining platforms, derelict cargo freighters and hazards

## dm_rasteroids

> Randomly generated asteroid field, possibly with other objects/hazards
