## Special Primaries

**Special weapons only fitted to certain ships at certain times**

| Starlight R&D | Matter Destabilisation Beam |
| -|- |
| Ammo | None |
| Heat | None |
| Damage | Infinite |
| Fire Rate | V/Low |
| Range | Infinite |
| Restrictions | "InstaGib" Gamemode Only<br />"Starlight R&D - Arena Combat Vessel Mark IX" Ship Only |
| Notes | An utterly devastating weapon designed by one technician at Starlight after a 72 hour caffeine fuelled meltdown.<br/>The Matter Destabilisation Beam instantly vaporises anything it hits by causing all the atoms in the target to simultaneously undergo fission.<br/>The weapon is considered so devastating its use is only permitted in televised "Instagib" arena events. (So named after the technician that developed the weapon, Professor Instantio Gibletius)<br/>Any use of this weapon outside of these events is punishable by the death of everyone even tangentially involved. |

| Notes                                       | Actually a slightly adapted (and distressingly cheap) Chinese firework marketed for professional displays. Banned from sale in most countries for its intended use after the flash was discovered to be so bright it actually caused temporary (and sometimes permanent) retinal damage to all those that observed it.  <br>A pylon mounted rocket it detonates either on impact or after a short flight time causing negligible damage to whomever it hits. However the flash from the detonation temporarily blinds the visual sensor arrays on most ships. It also looks really pretty whilst doing it. <br>Indiscriminate, will blind anyone in range for a short period of time. Blinding effect and period depends on range from detonation. Line of sight required. |

| Marketing Blurb | Blink instantly to your destination with the Starlight Mass Translocator. Baffle friends, surprise enemies.  |

## Pickup

**Utilities picked up during combat from fitting areas inside the arena or on allied Capital Ships**  
**Pickup Utilities are usually installed in the "Item" slot and can be activated on demand**

## Deployable

**Utilities that fit into either of the above categories, but can be deployed in an active state by the ship carrying them**  
**Deployable Utilities are activated on demand and take up an "Item" or "Utility" slot depending on how they are acquired**

| Starlight R&D | High Mass Translocator |
|-|-|
|Class|Installed|
|Effect| Deployed in two parts, the High Mass Translocator can be used to instantly jump ships that use it from one "gate" to the other. <br>Not the most stable of technologies, "gates" are prone to collapse after used by a lot of ships in a short period, or if they take moderate weapons fire.|
|Note | A single point variant of this exists, the *"Translocator Beacon"*, which can be jumped to by any teammate with a *Translocator Utility* fitted. The *High Mass Translocator* allows anyone to pass through without having to fit anything special.|

| HEP Technologies | FastLock™ Automatic-Tracking Turret System |
|-|-|
|Class|Installed|
|Effect | When deployed the ATS will automatically target any enemy ships that pass nearby and open fire with hybrid rounds, dealing moderate damage to shields, armour and hull.|
|Health | Low|
|Damage | Moderate (Universal)|
|Tracking Speed | High|
