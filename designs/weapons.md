## Special Primaries

**Special weapons only fitted to certain ships at certain times**

| Starlight R&D | Matter Destabilisation Beam |
| -|- |
| Ammo | None |
| Heat | None |
| Damage | Infinite |
| Fire Rate | V/Low |
| Range | Infinite |
| Restrictions | "InstaGib" Gamemode Only<br />"Starlight R&D - Arena Combat Vessel Mark IX" Ship Only |
| Notes | An utterly devastating weapon designed by one technician at Starlight after a 72 hour caffeine fuelled meltdown.<br/>The Matter Destabilisation Beam instantly vaporises anything it hits by causing all the atoms in the target to simultaneously undergo fission.<br/>The weapon is considered so devastating its use is only permitted in televised "Instagib" arena events. (So named after the technician that developed the weapon, Professor Instantio Gibletius)<br/>Any use of this weapon outside of these events is punishable by the death of everyone even tangentially involved. |

| Notes                                       | Actually a slightly adapted (and distressingly cheap) Chinese firework marketed for professional displays. Banned from sale in most countries for its intended use after the flash was discovered to be so bright it actually caused temporary (and sometimes permanent) retinal damage to all those that observed it.  <br>A pylon mounted rocket it detonates either on impact or after a short flight time causing negligible damage to whomever it hits. However the flash from the detonation temporarily blinds the visual sensor arrays on most ships. It also looks really pretty whilst doing it. <br>Indiscriminate, will blind anyone in range for a short period of time. Blinding effect and period depends on range from detonation. Line of sight required. |

| Notes      | Can only be used for a limited amount of time for “safety reasons” and is then jettisoned.                                                      |

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Effect          | Overloads a ship’s energy reactor forcing it to recharge faster than recommended safety limits      |
| Notes      | Can only be used for a limited amount of time for “safety reasons” and is then jettisoned                                                      |

| Notes      | Why fire missiles, when you can be the missile?<br>Ship Destroyed on Use<br>Requires line of sight, deflected/dispersed by dense objects and scenery.                                                      |

| Effect          | A single blast from this weapon disables all utilities in range and takes a chunk out of the energy reserves of nearby ships.      |
| Notes      | Indiscriminate, anyone nearby is affected.<br>Deploying vessel has energy reserves drained to 0 and cannot recharge for a period of time whilst their ship “reboots”.<br>All weapons except *Vulcan Cannon* are frozen.<br>Requires line of sight, deflected/dispersed by dense objects and scenery.                                                      |

## Deployable

**Utilities that fit into either of the above categories, but can be deployed in an active state by the ship carrying them**  
**Deployable Utilities are activated on demand and take up an "Item" or "Utility" slot depending on how they are acquired**

| Starlight R&D | High Mass Translocator |
|-|-|
|Class|Installed|
|Effect| Deployed in two parts, the High Mass Translocator can be used to instantly jump ships that use it from one "gate" to the other. <br>Not the most stable of technologies, "gates" are prone to collapse after used by a lot of ships in a short period, or if they take moderate weapons fire.|
|Note | A single point variant of this exists, the *"Translocator Beacon"*, which can be jumped to by any teammate with a *Translocator Utility* fitted. The *High Mass Translocator* allows anyone to pass through without having to fit anything special.|

| HEP Technologies | FastLock™ Automatic-Tracking Turret System |
|-|-|
|Class|Installed|
|Effect | When deployed the ATS will automatically target any enemy ships that pass nearby and open fire with hybrid rounds, dealing moderate damage to shields, armour and hull.|
|Health | Low|
|Damage | Moderate (Universal)|
|Tracking Speed | High|

| Grey Matter Technologies | Slipstream Inhibitor |
|-|-|
|Class|Installed|
|Effect | When deployed the *Slipstream Inhibitor* prevents all forms of *Slipstream Drive* from powering up by scrambling its targeting computer. |
|Range | Low|
|Notes | *Translocators* can still function using the safety override. However, they will be forced into an even more unpredictable "random translocate" mode. *OPERATION OF SLIPSTREAM TECHNOLOGY WITHIN AN INHIBITOR FIELD IS HIGHLY DISCOURAGED*|
