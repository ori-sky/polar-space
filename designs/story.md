title: A Basic Backstory
---
A new sector of space, simply known as *“The Expanse”* was recently discovered and charted by *The Sol Central Federation* science teams. *The Expanse* was found to be filled with rich deposits of Ores, Gasses and other materials critical for the manufacturing of almost everything.
News of this discovery spread fast, three great megacorporations; <AEG Manufacturing>, <Core Industries> and <Ntek Solutions> all quickly attempted to stake claim to this region by sending in vast capital ships equipped with the resources to harvest materials, and wage a war.
Fight through asteroid fields, dense nebulae, processing facilities and vast wreckage to help your corporation make its mark on the region.
