# The Story So Far
A new sector of space, simply known as *“The Expanse”* was recently discovered and charted by *Sol Central Federation* (SCF) science teams.  
*The Expanse* was found to be filled with rich deposits of Ores, Gasses and other materials critical for the manufacturing of almost everything.  
News of this discovery spread fast, three great mega-corporations; *AEG Manufacturing*, *Core Industries* and *Ntek Solutions* all quickly attempted to stake claim to this region by sending in vast capital ships equipped with the resources to harvest materials, and wage a war.  
Fight through asteroid fields, dense nebulae, processing facilities and vast wreckage to help your corporation make its mark on the region.
