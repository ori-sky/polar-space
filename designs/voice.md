# Ship's Computer

## Tutorial

"Welcome Pilot. I am the Enhanced Virtual Assistant assigned to your vessel. You may call me EVA."  

### Navigation 101

"All ships you will find yourself piloting have a full 6 degrees of freedom. Stand by whilst I launch this vessel and move it to a safe distance from the Capital Ship."  
"I have now unlocked your yaw controls, please yaw the vessel left and right." (Graphic shown as demonstration)  
"I have now unlocked your pitch controls, please pitch the vessel up and down." (Graphic shown as demonstration)  
"I have now unlocked your roll controls, please roll the vessel." (Graphic shown as demonstration)  
"I have now unlocked your strafe controls, please strafe the vessel up, down, left and right." (Graphic shown as demonstration)  
"Please stand by whilst I enable your primary Ion Friction Drive... Your primary IFD is now enabled, please fly forward, then come to a complete halt." (Graphic shown as demonstration)  
"Now, please stand by whilst I enable your secondary IFD... Your secondary IFD is now enabled, please fly backwards, then come to a complete halt." (Graphic shown as demonstration)    
"I have enabled your IFD Overdrive System, please enable it and fly forward, then come to a complete halt." (Graphic shown as demonstration)  
"You will have noticed that deploying your IFD Overdrive has drained some of your stored capacitor energy. Prolonged usage of IFD Overdrive is not recommended as a result."  

### Weaponry 101

"Your ship is equipped with primary and secondary weapons arrays. I am enabling the first slot of the primary weapons array now." (weapon online sound cue)  
"I have highlighted a target for you, please line it up in your targeting reticule and pull on your primary weapons trigger."  
"That weapon you fired was the K&H TX1 Vulkan Cannon. It is a simple projectile weapon that fires reconstituted shards of absorbed space dust. It is moderately effective at damaging armour and hull plating."  
"I have now added shields to the highlighted target, please resume firing."
