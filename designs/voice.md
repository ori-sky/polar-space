"I have now unlocked your roll controls, please roll the vessel." (Graphic shown as demonstration)  
"I have now unlocked your strafe controls, please strafe the vessel up, down, left and right." (Graphic shown as demonstration)  
"Please stand by whilst I enable your primary Ion Friction Drive... Your primary IFD is now enabled, please fly forward, then come to a complete halt." (Graphic shown as demonstration)

### Weaponry 101

"Your ship is equipped with primary and secondary weapons arrays. I am enabling the first slot of the primary weapons array now." (weapon online sound cue)  
"I have highlighted a target for you, please line it up in your targeting reticule and pull on your primary weapons trigger."

"I have now added shields to the highlighted target, please resume firing."
