title: The Ships of "Spacegame"

## Basic ship concepts
All *Sol Central Federation* based ships follow similar component design concepts. Although manufacturers can implement things in different ways.

### Propulsion
All *SCF* ships use a *Charged Ion Friction Drive* (or "IFD") for primary propulsion.  
Usually directed out the back of the ship through adjustable exhaust nozzles with some of the energy directed through forward facing manifolds to provide ships with the ability to fly backwards at only slightly reduced top speeds.
