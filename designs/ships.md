# Basic ship concepts
All *Sol Central Federation* (SCF) based ships follow similar component design concepts. Although manufacturers can implement things in different ways.

## Propulsion
All *SCF* ships use a *Charged Ion Friction Drive* (or "IFD") for primary propulsion.  
Usually directed out the back of the ship through adjustable exhaust nozzles with some of the energy directed through forward facing manifolds to provide ships with the ability to fly backwards at only slightly reduced top speeds.  
The IFD is a self contained, highly efficient system that does not use main ship power during normal operation.
However most ships are also fitted with an *IFD Overdrive System* that can tap power from the ships capacitor to increase thrust drastically. This is incredibly taxing on the capacitor though and will drain power rapidly.  

## Weapons Array
*SCF* ships have a class standardised weapons array allowing them to fit a wide variety of "Primary" and "Secondary" weapons for specific types of hull.  
Primary weapons are usually forward firing energy or kinetic weapons.  
Secondary weapons are usually pylon mounted missiles or rockets.  
Some hulls can fit Utility weapons in either Primary or Secondary slots sacrificing firepower for additional abilities.  
Weapons usually have internal power supplies or ammo reserves. If they didn't they would quickly overload a ship's power reactor.  
Some utilities have been manufactured that allow pilots to route excess ship capacitor power into the weapons array, however.
### Heat Dissipation
Their power may be endless, but most Primary Weapons (some Secondary, and some Utilities) generate large amounts of heat if used for long periods of time.  
This is drawn away by a *heat pump* which channels the heat away from the weapons array. It can only draw away a certain amount of heat over time, if an overheat situation is detected the weapons array will completely shut off until it has fully cooled for safety reasons.  
There are some situations where power from the capacitor power can be routed to the *heat pump* to increase it's operational speed and draw heat away quicker.  
Turning off the overheat protection on the weapons array is **highly advised against and may lead to the destruction of your ship.**

## Ship Power Systems
*SCF* Ship power systems are split into two components, the *Central Reactor Core* (Reactor) and a *Rapid Discharge/Recharge Capacitor Bank* (RD/R Capacitor).
### Reactor
Each ship manufacturer has their own preferred reactor design and fuelling method.  
It's main purpose is to recharge the *RD/R Capacitors* aboard a ship.  
Connecting a reactor directly to ship systems is... ill advised.
### RD/R Capacitor Bank
The *Rapid Discharge/Recharge Capacitor Bank* is the core of a ships power requirements.  
Systems that do not have self-contained power sources will tap from it to function, such as Utilities, Items, Pickups and Boosters.
