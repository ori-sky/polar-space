# Basic ship concepts
All *Sol Central Federation* (SCF) based ships follow similar component design concepts. Although manufacturers can implement things in different ways.

## Propulsion
All *SCF* ships use a *Charged Ion Friction Drive* (or "IFD") for primary propulsion.  
Usually directed out the back of the ship through adjustable exhaust nozzles with some of the energy directed through forward facing manifolds to provide ships with the ability to fly backwards at only slightly reduced top speeds.

## Weapons Array
*SCF* ships have a class standardised weapons array allowing them to fit a wide variety of "Primary" and "Secondary" weapons for specific types of hull.  
Primary weapons are usually forward firing energy or kinetic weapons.  
Secondary weapons are usually pylon mounted missiles or rockets.  
Some hulls can fit Utility weapons in either Primary or Secondary slots sacrificing firepower for additional abilities.  
Weapons usually have internal power supplies or ammo reserves. If they didn't they would quickly overload a ship's power reactor.

## Ship Power Systems
*SCF* Ship power systems are split into two components, the *Central Reactor Core* (Reactor) and a *Rapid Discharge/Recharge Capacitor Bank* (RD/R Capacitor).
### Reactor
Each ship manufacturer has their own preferred reactor design and fuelling method.  
It's main purpose is to recharge the *RD/R Capacitors* aboard a ship.  
Connecting a reactor directly to ship systems is... ill advised.
### RD/R
