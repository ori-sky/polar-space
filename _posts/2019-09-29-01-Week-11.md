description: Things that seem simple, aren't this week. From RNG to Steamworks, stuff that should have been easy really wasn't.

Y'all mind if I scream?

# "This should be easy!"

A phrase we have seriously regretted saying this week, on several occasions.  
I'll let ‚ö° Shockk get into some more detail in a minute, but here's what we've got done this week.

## We've got "Steamworks" integration now!
That means that if you are playing Spacegame, Steam detects it properly. We also have an AppID which means we can now distrubute the game over the Steam network.  
We plan to release in Early Access, but there's a few milestones we want to hit first.  
The Tech Demo will be available on this site sooner, but will be less feature complete.  
During the Tech Demo phase, the release on the website and on Steam will be kept in sync, but once we leave that phase, Steam will be the only place to get releases.

## Keeping the world in sync

Our current main map uses random number generation to create the asteroid spread, unfortunately this means that everyone sees a different map as most things are still handled client side at this time. The server just tells clients what all the other clients are doing.  
So, the RNG is now "seeded", this means that the clients all share what seed they are using and therefore share the "randomness" so everyone sees the same world.

## Model Progress

üê∞ The Rabbit has also been working hard on our ship model, I linked the concept art [last week](/polar-space{% post_url 2019-09-22-01-Week-10 %}), and it's coming along nicely. We hope to replace our placeholder model with it soon. Here's a sneak peek.

# What next?

Collision and the Damage model are taking a little longer than expected, along with some placeholder sound effects to make things feel a little less... quiet.  
We're also running internal testing with colleagues on some other platforms and hardware configurations to make sure everything is stable before a more public release.

See you all next week!
