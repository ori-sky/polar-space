Pseudo randomness is a remarkable concept—one that we rarely put a lot of thought into how it actually works. So, the purpose of this blog post is to detail everything that went into our custom pseudo random generation class and explain how exactly it works.

# Background

When we talk about random generation, we aren't just talking about generating numbers from 0 to 1 or even from -2 to 17. We're talking about more complex generation like points on the surface of a sphere, points within the area of a circle/disc, and more.

Up until very recently, our game engine used the random functionality available in GLM whenever we needed any randomness. This worked well for ages, but we recently realized that Spacegame actually has a few extra requirements on random number generation that GLM can't give us.

1. We need our random number generation to be predictable.
2. We need to maintain and advance discrete random generation states.
3. We need strong performance!

Let's take a look at why we need these guarantees, why GLM can't provide them, and how our new random generation class provides them.
