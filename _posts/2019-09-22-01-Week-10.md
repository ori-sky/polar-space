What a difference a week makes!

# What's the big deal?

May as well get the really cool thing out of the way first. We mentioned having sync [last week](/polar-space{% post_url 2019-09-16-01-Week-9 %}), however now we also have a "Master Server" that all our test builds are set to talk to. So any test build that is opened by anyone on the internet will connect to that server and everyone connected can see everyone else! 

We also have a Steam AppID, which means that once we have the game in a state we consider "playable" we'll be able to distribute the tech demo on Steam for all supported platforms.

# What's missing?

Well, we still don't have a damage model yet, or collision detection, or a way to sync the "world map", but once we have those we'll consider the "tech demo" ready for a general release and you'll all get to give it a try in one big deathmatch.

# Ship Concept Art

üê∞ The Rabbit has also produced a cool piece of ship design concept art, this will hopefully be the first "Fighter" in the game, and will look really cool once it's fully modelled.

We hope to have a prototype model of this in the first tech demo release.
