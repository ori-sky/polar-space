description: A discussion on the curse that is "Timesinks" and what they can do to development.

"Timesinks" are a nebulous thing. You'd think they'd be easy to avoid, just don't do anything non-essential to development. Right?  
Well, not really. Take this website, for instance.  
We started working on it at around 5pm, and didn't finish it, fully, until after midnight. A massive, horrifying timesink that came with strange problems that needed debugged and caused no progress for the project.
