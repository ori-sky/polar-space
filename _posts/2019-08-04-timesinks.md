description: A discussion on the curse that is "Timesinks" and what they can do to development.

"Timesinks" are a nebulous thing. You'd think they'd be easy to avoid, just don't do anything non-essential to development. Right?  
Well, not really. Take this website, for instance.  
We started working on it at around 5pm, and didn't finish it, fully, until after midnight. A massive, horrifying timesink that came with strange problems that needed debugged and caused no progress for the project.  
Why did we start? We felt that now was the time to start a development blog, and thought it would be quick and easy to throw together. By the time we were several hours in, it was too late, we now *had* to finish what we were doing on it.  

**Could it have been avoided?**  
*Probably not.*

**Why couldn't it have been avoided?**  
Well, we'd eventually need a development blog to keep players up to date on the development of the game, and to muse or share ideas and thoughts (like this one).
