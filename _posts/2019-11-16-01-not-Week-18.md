# Big things are coming!

‚ö° Shockk has made some big changes to the engine over the last week and we've got some really amazing stuff to show you!

üê∞ The Rabbit has been working on the models and textures all for us to integrate in to our improved engine.

Myself, I've been working with colleagues on storyboarding with more work on that tomorrow.



Hopefully we'll have a lot of awesome stuff to show you on Monday!



See you all then.
