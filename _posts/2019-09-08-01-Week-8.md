Now that ‚ö° Shockk is back from their holidays, that's us getting back into the swing of things.

# What happened last week?

Not much to be honest, nothing worth writing a dedicated blog post about, at least.  
üê∞ The Rabbit has been working away in the background with ship concepts and level ideas, and I've been compiling ideas and trying to see where the project could be trimmed back a bit to make development a little smoother.

# What next?

‚ö° Shockk has resumed work on the netcode, with our updated plan to release the tech demo with a variant of our planned netcode that's not as streamlined, but shows that the game works.  
Complete with implementing a weapon, basic health and collision. After the complex mess that has been writing custom netcode, that should be easy.  
There will be a "Public Server" for the tech demo, and all clients will be hardcoded to connect to it, so anyone can drop in and check it out.

# ETA?

When it's ready‚Ñ¢  
I'm partially kidding here, we *hope* some time by the end of the month, but don't want to set any strict deadlines as we don't want to disappoint any followers, or demotivate ourselves by missing a deadline.  
As soon as a tech demo of any kind is ready, it will be announced here, along with instructions on how to run it.



See You Next Week! (for real this time)
