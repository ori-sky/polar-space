It's been what feels like a very long week and we're finally making headway on a few fronts.

# Debug Console

Progress with the debug developer console has been really, really slow and unfortunately I haven't yet been able to get it to the state I'd like it to be at. A lot more has been involved with expanding the capabilities of our action system than I originally imagined, and debugging issues with these new capabilities has slowed me down considerably.

At long last, however, the action system now fully supports both prioritized bindings (i.e. bindings can take higher or lower precedences over other bindings to the same action) and interception (i.e. a binding can prevent other bindings from executing after it).

The upshot of all this is that we can now type into the console—layered on top of the world so as to preserve the current state—and none of the movement keys will trigger any movement.

Needless to say, this is huge and the rammifications are greater than that of a mere debug console. For example, we can now implement stuff like pause menus, nested menus with state that can kept alive while navigating sub-menus, etc.
