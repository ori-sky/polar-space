Just over three weeks ago, a friend and I decided to embark on an *epic journey* into the world of game development.
So far this has not proven to be a terrible mistake.

Normally content to just play games we had just grabbed an abandonware copy of [Hellbender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellbender_(video_game)) for some 1-on-1 spaceship dogfighting action. Whilst fun, the game was slow and unstable (it is from 1995 after all), so we went looking for a modern equivalent. We could not find one that met our needs.

 - LAN based Multiplayer
 - Full 360Â° movement
 - A variety of weaponry
 - Interesting worlds

A game from 1995 had these things, but nothing
