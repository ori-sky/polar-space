## The Story So Far

Just over three weeks ago, Shockk and I decided to embark on an *epic journey* into the world of game development.
So far this has not proven to be a terrible mistake.

Normally content to just play games we had grabbed an abandonware copy of [Hellbender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellbender_(video_game)) for some 1-on-1 spaceship dogfighting action. Whilst fun, the game was slow and unstable (it is from 1995 after all), so we went looking for a modern equivalent. We could not find one that met our needs:

 - LAN based Multiplayer
 - Full 360Â° movement
 - A variety of weaponry
 - Interesting worlds

A game from 1995 had these things, but nothing modern did. The closest we found was [EVE Valkyrie](https://www.evevalkyrie.com/) but it has been discontinued (maybe?), has a rather intense set of system requirements, and was a bit pricey to just check out if it turned out to not be what we were looking for.
Shockk decided to play some [Overwatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_(video_game)) instead and I started playing [EVERSPACE](https://everspace-game.com/) up until we went for dinner.
Over dinner we discussed the gameplay experiences of what we'd been playing, then it came to us. If we couldn't *find* the right game, we could *make* it!

Shockk already has some background in writing game code from his time working on [Freefall](https://freefall.space), and I have experience managing small projects. We also have friends that are more artistic than us and are willing to lend a hand!

## What we've got done in 3 weeks
To put it simply, we've gone from this:
