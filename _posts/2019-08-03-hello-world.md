Just over three weeks ago, a friend and I decided to embark on an *epic journey* into the world of game development.
So far this has not proven to be a terrible mistake.

Normally content to just play games we had just grabbed an abandonware copy of [Hellbender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellbender_(video_game)) for some 1-on-1 spaceship dogfighting action. Whilst fun, the game was slow, and unstable (it is from 1995 after all)
