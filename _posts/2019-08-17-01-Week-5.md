description: Our third weekly update describing what we did this week.

Another week, another blog post! Unfortunately, this week's update will be kind of sparse as the work has gone almost exclusively into the rewind/replay functionality required for networking.

# Netcode

We're still making slow progress with the rewind/replay code, fixing bugs and uncovering new bugs as we go. My original estimate of a few weeks for this was actually wrong--it's probably going to take longer than that due to the sheer number of issues we've had getting it to work!

I'm sad that I'm not really able to offer more details to what exactly the issues are, as the whole thing is a massive web that requires some pretty intricate knowledge of how the engine works. Once this is working though, I'll definitely write a detailed technical post on it all.

# Future

I'm on holiday for a few weeks! I'm going to try and get a bit of work done on the netcode and continue to debug the issues we're seeing with the rewind/replay system, but I doubt I'll be able to get very much done until I'm back. In the meantime, we'll be working more on the design posts available here on the website, and I'll probably also set aside some time to improve quality of life stuff for our development environment and such.

The Fox will see you next week with another quick update!
