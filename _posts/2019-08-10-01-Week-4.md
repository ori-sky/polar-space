# Slow and Steady

Well, what have we been up to this week?  
What looks like "not a lot" is actually a lot of behind the scenes stuff.  

## Netcode

Previously our netcode sent game actions to other players, like "move foward", "move backward", "yaw" "pitch", etc. These would be performed as soon as they were received by clients, but this introduced the problem of desync. Check [this](/polar-space{% post_url 2019-08-04-01-udp-multiplayer %}) post for more details on all of this.

This week, our work has gone into reworking large portions of our engine to allow us to rewind time (actions, positions, orientations, etc). We can then replay actions on top of the old state to get back to the new state deterministically. It's not perfect, but the basis for clientâ€“server time synchronization is now in place.

We're now able to rewind to the point in time where a remote action like "move forward" happened, apply it then, and finally fast-forward back to the present time. It's by no means complete yet, as we still have synchronization issues, but this is a huge step forward for the engine and for our game networking.

We'll write a follow-up technical blog post on this once it's complete.
