# Getting a feel for Spacegame

The artistic direction of Spacegame is something that we've struggled with for a bit, but we've ended up deciding to hybridise a mix of styles and run with it.  
We have a few friends of the project coming up with come concept art and designs to fit this hopefully unique and interesting style!

# Speaking of Friends

Right now information about this project largely spreads by word of mouth and in some places we've spoken about it interested parties have agreed to contribute concept artwork, designs and ideas. We hope to show these off in the coming weeks!
