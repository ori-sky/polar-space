<h1>A Currently Untitled Space Shooter</h1>

<h2>Who are you? </h2>
Two people that got bored of not having the exact game they wanted to play one day. <br>We've also brought some friends along for the ride!

<h2>What are you doing?</h2>
Writing and designing a Multiplayer 3D Space Shooter inspired by various things:

Classic Shooters, like [Unreal Tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament) and [Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(series))<br>
Modern class-based shooters like [Team Fortress 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2) and [Overwatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_(video_game))<br>
as well as other space shooters like [EVERSPACE](https://everspace-game.com/), [EVE Valkyrie](https://www.evevalkyrie.com/) and [Microsoft Hellbender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellbender_(video_game))

<h2>Why are you doing this?</h2>
To hone our programming, game design and artistic skills, and to have some fun in the process!

<h2>What engine are you using?</h2>
We've built our own! It's called "Polar".<br>
No need to say it, we think we're insane too.<br>
If you want to check out the codebase, click [here](https://github.com/polar-engine/polar)

<h2>Can I try the game out yet?</h2>
Not just now, we have a small group of friends acting as internal testers, but it's not much of a "Game" quite yet. More like a tech-demo. <br>
Once we're happy with it though, we'll start releasing the tech demos here!

<h2>This website is really janky! What's up with that?</h2>
We only have a vague idea of what we are doing, so this website is as experimental as our game code! <br>

<h2>Ok, I'm interested. How do I follow your progress?</h2>
There *should* be some buttons up on the top bar for you to click on to take you to various sections of this site with posts by members of the team.<br>
The plan is to have a big update each week and sporadic updates from other team members about the code base, art assets and more.
