title: A Currently Untitled Space Shooter

### Who are you?
Two people that got bored of not having the exact game they wanted to play one day.  
We've also brought some friends along for the ride!

### What are you doing?
Writing and designing a Multiplayer 3D Space Shooter inspired by various things:

Classic Shooters, like [Unreal Tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament) and [Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(series))  
Modern class-based shooters like [Team Fortress 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2) and [Overwatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_(video_game))  
as well as other space shooters like [EVERSPACE](https://everspace-game.com/), [EVE Valkyrie](https://www.evevalkyrie.com/) and [Microsoft Hellbender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellbender_(video_game))

### Why are you doing this?
To hone our programming, game design and artistic skills, and to have some fun in the process!

### What engine are you using?
We've built our own! It's called "Polar".  
No need to say it, we think we're insane too.  
If you want to check out the codebase, click [here](https://github.com/polar-engine/polar)

### Can I try the game out yet?
Not just now, we have a small group of friends acting as internal testers, but it's not much of a "Game" quite yet. More like a tech-demo.  
Once we're happy with it though, we'll start releasing the tech demos here!

### This website is really janky! What's up with that?
We only have a vague idea of what we are doing, so this website is as experimental as our game code! <br>

### Ok, I'm interested. How do I follow your progress?
There *should* be some buttons up on the top bar for you to click on to take you to various sections of this site with [posts by members of the team](/polar-space/blog), [information about game design](/polar-space/design) and [releases](/polar-space/release)  
The plan is to have a big update each week and sporadic updates from other team members about the code base, art assets and more.
